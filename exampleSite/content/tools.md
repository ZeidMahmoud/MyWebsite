### My Tools 

I use [slackware 15 ](www.slackware.com)as my OS on my main laptop which is [Thinkpad lenovo T510](https://www.productindetail.com/pn/lenovo-thinkpad-t510-4384). It took me a lot of time, effort, and dedication to become as proficient as possible with this amazing OS. I have been familiar with it for about three consecutive years, primarily as a security researcher. While I mainly aim to be part of the red team, I use Windows like most people—not for personal use, but for penetration testing, hacking, and malware analysis.
