### About me

I'm fascinated by the potential of technology to transform our world and solve some of the most pressing issues we face. I subscribe to the principles of Effective Accelerationism [e/acc](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39191600), which advocates for the rapid advancement of technology, especially artificial intelligence, to achieve a future where abundance and prosperity are universal. I believe that through innovation and the free market, we can create a better world for all.

I create this personal website with a focus on simplicity and intuitive navigation. I craft all content using Vim, an editor I've been working with for the past three years. While I pursued computer science studies from 2019 to 2023, I initially struggled to complete the program. This experience temporarily dampened my enthusiasm for the field. However, my perspective transformed completely after discovering a YouTube channel focused on Linux, which opened my eyes to a whole new world of computing.
despite spending four years in formal computer science education, I realized how much remained unexplored. Linux and open-source software were entirely new concepts to me before university. My early education focused primarily on conventional programming and web development - teaching PHP, Apache servers, and other standard computer science curriculum elements. Discovering this alternative computing landscape felt like unlocking a door to endless possibilities and fascinating specialties I never knew existed.
