I have been using an older laptop for about three years now, and it’s been working perfectly without any issues. It’s a [Lenovo ThinkPad T510](https://www.productindetail.com/pn/lenovo-thinkpad-t510-4384), a model from 2011, and I use it daily for studying, work, and pretty much everything else.

Some people might wonder why I still use such an "outdated" laptop in my daily life. The truth is, I love exploring new technology, but for me, "new" doesn’t always mean the latest or most advanced tech on the market. Instead, I enjoy experimenting with tools and systems that bring me joy and efficiency without the risk of wasting money or time.

i’ve been following [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz) on YouTube for quite some time now, and I’ve become a big fan of his approach to technology and how he integrates it into daily life. At first, I found it hard to understand why he put so much effort into building his custom setups. I thought, Why go through all that trouble when you could just install Windows or macOS and call it a day? That was my initial reaction, at least. But as I delved deeper into his philosophy, I began to see things differently. When you understand how certain operating systems can exploit users or limit their control, his approach starts to make a lot of sense. It’s not just about the effort—it’s about reclaiming autonomy and understanding the tools we use every day.

I also want to highlight another YouTube channel I absolutely love, called [anahr](https://www.youtube.com/@anaHr), run by a man named Ahmed. What makes his channel stand out is his incredible ability to balance technical expertise with a strong focus on privacy. [anahr](https://www.youtube.com/@anaHr) the lecters are a good for maintaining online anonymity, which is something I deeply respect in today’s digital age. His approach to privacy isn’t just theoretical—he demonstrates practical ways to protect your identity and data, making his content both educational and actionable.

He’s also highly skilled in other academic fields, such as mathematics and physics, which he teaches on his channel. His explanations are clear, concise, and often infused with real-world applications, making complex topics accessible to a wide audience. Whether he’s breaking down advanced equations or explaining the fundamentals of physics,[anahr](https://www.youtube.com/@anaHr) has a unique way of making learning engaging and relatable.

I also use a [lenovo-chrombook N23](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-n-series/n23-chromebook/88elc1s0873). t has only 16GB of storage and 1GB of RAM, making it a very minimal device for anyone. I installed Arch Linux on it to explore its capabilities despite its limited hardware.
if you want to know how I removed chromeOS and installed arch , you shoudl watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6oyqrrXTLM&t=843s&pp=ygUraG93IHRvIHJlbW9lIGNocm9tb3MgYW5kIGluc2xsIGFub3RoZXIgb3N0YQ%3D%3D)
