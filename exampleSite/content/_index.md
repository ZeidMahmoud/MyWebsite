### why I made this webstie

There is a website obesity crisis. bloated websites full of scripts, ads, and trackers are slowing your readers down every time they try to read your well-crafted content.

I created this for myself as a way to express my perspective on the world and share my point of view. it can be difficult for some to find a space where they feel comfortable speaking with others and trusting people. personally, I  have a hard time speaking freely with others face-to-face. 

This is the fist website that I build for my own use and to talk about my self and share the things that I like and interesting for me and I love to share it with other people. 
I made this website to be as fast as possible to make it easy to explore for people and make there experence fun and smoth.
